# Recipes

These are kitchen recipes, not coding recipes.

The library folder is the Calibre library.

The markdown folder is the original Markdown file. Many people have used the Mastercook format, I know. But using Markdown would make it easy for me to convert the recipe to any other format I'd like using Pandoc. One of these days I'll create a script that will transform these into Mastercook text format.

## Feel free to add to the collection. 

Make a pull request for your additions.

Create one recipe per file. 

Save the file in the markdown folder.

The format of the filename is `00_Title_of_Recipe.md`. The `00` is literal since I'll be changing the number after adding it into the Calibre library.

The format of the file is:

```
# Title of Recipe

- 1 1/2 item two
- 1 1/2 units item 3

**Procedure**
